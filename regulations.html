        <h2>Rules and Regulations you should follow in Airports</h2>
        <p>It might be difficult to go through airport security, but understanding the rules can help. Take a look at these pointers to help you get through the security queues faster.Travelers may find through airport security checkpoints to be a laborious
            task. However, if passengers understand why certain protocols are in place, the process of boarding an airplane can become less onerous. It might be difficult to go through airport security, but understanding the rules can help. Take a look
            at these pointers to help you get through the security queues.<br><br> Kawika Riley, a spokesman for the Transportation Security Administration, said the group's mission is to reduce risk while minimizing aggravation to travelers at checkpoints.<br><br>            "Transportation security is a balancing act," Riley said.<br><br>Riley believes that the only way to make air travel completely secure is to eliminate it entirely. For most travelers, this is not an option. It assists passengers in understanding
            why security safeguards are in place. The following are the most typical TSA-enforced airline security measures, as well as the reasons for their existence:</p>
        <h4>Remove your laptop from its bag and place it in a different bin.</h4>
        <p>Riley said TSA officials look for bombs "that appear innocent" but might be hidden within the body of computers and electrical devices. If a laptop is separated in a canister, TSA can check it more readily, clearly, and swiftly. If you don't want
            to pull your computer out every time, invest in a TSA-approved bag with a clear image of the computer in the X-ray machine.</p>
        <h4>Liquids, gels, and aerosols should all be 3 ounces or less, and placed in a clear, one-quart zip-top bag.</h4>
        <p>Many individuals are baffled as to how their toothpaste or perfume might be considered hazardous. However, explosives specialists re-evaluated security methods after three UK-based terrorists were arrested plotting to blow up at least ten airliners
            with ordinary-looking, small-liquid explosives 5 years ago.They concluded that a terrorist would be unlikely to manufacture and ignite an explosive device using only a few tiny containers and no matches. An assembled bomb can be detected by
            checked luggage screening equipment, but checkpoint machines have a harder time detecting them. The screening procedure is made faster and more efficient by keeping some liquids together in a plastic bag.</p>
        <h4>Hats, shoes, belts, and jackets should all be removed.</h4>
        <p>Small arms and other dangerous items can easily be hidden in these items. In 2001, after "shoe bomber" Richard Colvin Reid tried to detonate explosives hidden in his shoes on a commercial aircraft, TSA began a separate search for loose objects.
            Belts and other metal accessories can cause false alarms for metal detectors. After removal, the alarm will detect any other prohibited metal objects on your body.</p>
        <h4>Walk past the body scanner.</h4>
        <p>Metal detectors will filter out guns, knives and other prohibited items, but the advanced imaging technology scanner implemented in 2010 will screen passengers for prohibited non-metallic items, such as matches or drugs. Gutheinz said the scanner
            is effective because TSA security inspectors can check for prohibited items hidden under passenger clothing. This process takes a few seconds, not a 2- to 5-minute touch. Passengers can expect that as the threat of terrorism continues to evolve,
            aviation security procedures will evolve as well. Be prepared to get through the security line faster. When complying with airport safety rules, remember the goal: to make all of us safer.</p>
